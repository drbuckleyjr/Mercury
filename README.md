# Mercury
Mercury programming language
The "primality" and "primes" modules and related test platforms implement and use a Miller-Rabin primality test to
explore prime numbers. The "wip" version of these modules relies upon Mercury's integer library for integers of
arbitrary precision. The "mpm" versions rely upon use of the Tommath integers, while the "gmp" versions use an inteface
with the GNU GMP library.
